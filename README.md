# Firedrake Playground

This playground repo contains several scripts to solve some problems that I faced 
around or the ones I found interest, using [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/) 
framework, a very powerful FEM toolkit that provides a Python high-level syntax 
(more specifically, a Domain Specific Language - DSL) and automatic code generation.

# Available scripts
